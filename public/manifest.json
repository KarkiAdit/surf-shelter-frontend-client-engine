    "description": "Surf Shelter is an intelligent recommendation system, trained using supervised machine learning, independently for each type of fraudulent website (click-fraud, pay-fraud, and malicious). Each model is a binary classifier, with numerical features and labels obtained using publicly available APIs. The numerical features are carefully assessed to determine their statistical dependence on the labels to construct a training set. Finally, a binary classification algorithm, such as SVM or Neural Networks, is used to create the model, chosen based on performance. All three independent models are integrated into Surf Shelter to predict a websiteâ€™s behavior.",
